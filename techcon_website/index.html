          CareerConnections is an intense 2-hour recruiting event. Technical
          staff and recruiters from SRC member companies are on hand to provide
          information to our SRC Research Scholars about each company. During
          this event, resumes and contact information are exchanged, while many
          companies actively recruit for open and upcoming job and internship
          opportunities. If you are looking to find a job or fill a job
          requisition, this is the place to do it!
