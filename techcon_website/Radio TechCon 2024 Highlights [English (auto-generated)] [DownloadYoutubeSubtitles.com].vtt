massive experience where the audience

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.040
could lie down and take some time out

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.840
and be surrounded by sound when I was

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.520

good to see a big overview of the

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.040
industry I keep coming back to radio

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.360
techcon year after year after year

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.560
because of the absolute breadth and

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.360
diversity of the speakers taking to the

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.800
stage the people speak

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.599
are not only showing me things that I've

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.000
wondered about but also things I've

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.560
never even considered the talks that

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I've been lucky enough to have time to

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.760
listen to after traveling down here have

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.360
been excellent and the great thing about

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.159
this conference is the extent to which

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.360
people chip in with with questions they

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.440
want answers to take back to their radio

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.720
stations I'll definitely come back again

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.720

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.200
next radio techon it really is a a

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.879
conference that covers pretty much

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.920
everything in such a neat little package

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:08.230
